# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to creating an open and inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and respected.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Providing constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team via **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DarshanAguru/react-native-utility-kit/issues)**.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.
