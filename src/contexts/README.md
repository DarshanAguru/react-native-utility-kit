# ✨ Contexts

Contexts are **utility providers** designed to add global functionality and shared state to the components they wrap. Instead of manually passing props down multiple levels or handling repetitive logic in every component, these contexts make your app development **cleaner, faster, and more maintainable**.

✔ **Pre-built for common use cases**  
✔ **Fully customizable** to match your app’s architecture.  
✔ **Optimized for performance and scalability**  

Perfect for creating **robust, theme-aware, and state-driven** applications in React and React Native! 🚀
